# Daily Transactions Setup Guide

## Overview

The BANGZ SALOON system now includes a separate **Daily_Transactions** sheet that stores individual transactions with enhanced daily reporting capabilities. This provides better organization and analysis of daily business operations.

## New Google Sheet Structure

## How It Works

### Automatic Dual Storage

When a new transaction is created through the system:

1. **Main Transactions Sheet**: Stores the transaction in the existing format
2. **Daily Transactions Sheet**: Automatically creates an enhanced entry with additional fields

### New API Endpoints

The system now includes these new endpoints:

- `getDailyTransactions` - Get all daily transactions
- `getDailyTransactionsByDate` - Get transactions for a specific date
- `createDailyTransaction` - Create a new daily transaction entry

## Benefits

### Enhanced Daily Reporting

- **Better Organization**: Transactions are stored with additional metadata
- **Day of Week Analysis**: Track performance by day of the week
- **Monthly Grouping**: Easy filtering by month and year
- **Service Category Tracking**: Better categorization of services

### Improved Analytics

- **Worker Performance**: Detailed daily breakdown by worker
- **Service Analysis**: Track popular services by category
- **Payment Method Trends**: Monitor cash vs card usage
- **Time-based Insights**: Analyze peak hours and days

## Testing the Feature

### Using Browser Console

1. Open the salon management system
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Run the test function:

```javascript
// Test daily transactions functionality
testDailyTransactions();
```

This will:
- Fetch all daily transactions
- Get today's transactions
- Create a sample transaction
- Display results in the console

### Manual Testing

1. **Create a Transaction**: Use the normal service entry form
2. **Check Main Sheet**: Verify transaction appears in "Transactions" sheet
3. **Check Daily Sheet**: Verify enhanced entry appears in "Daily_Transactions" sheet
4. **Verify Data**: Ensure all fields are populated correctly

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy Updated Google Apps Script

1. Open your Google Apps Script project
2. Replace the code with the updated `google-apps-scripts.js`
3. Save and deploy as a web app
4. Update the script URL in your system

### 2. Initialize the Daily Transactions Sheet

The sheet will be created automatically when you run the setup function:

```javascript
// In browser console
googleIntegration.makeRequest('setupSpreadsheet', {}, 'GET');
```

### 3. Verify Setup

Check that the "Daily_Transactions" sheet exists with the correct headers.

## Usage Examples

### Get Today's Transactions

```javascript
const today = new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-GB');
const todayData = await googleIntegration.getDailyTransactionsByDate(today);
console.log('Today\'s transactions:', todayData);
```

### Get All Daily Transactions

```javascript
const allDailyTransactions = await googleIntegration.getDailyTransactions();
console.log('All daily transactions:', allDailyTransactions);
```

### Create a Daily Transaction

```javascript
const transactionData = {
    date: '21/12/2023',
    time: '14:30',
    worker: 'John Smith',
    serviceCategory: 'Hair Services',
    serviceName: 'Basic Hair Cut',
    customerName: 'Ahmed Ali',
    amount: 55,
    paymentMethod: 'Cash',
    notes: 'Regular customer'
};

const result = await googleIntegration.createDailyTransaction(transactionData);
console.log('Transaction created:', result);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Sheet Not Found**: Run `setupSpreadsheet` to create the Daily_Transactions sheet
2. **Data Not Syncing**: Check that both main and daily transactions are being created
3. **Missing Fields**: Verify that all required fields are being passed

### Debug Commands

```javascript
// Test the entire daily transactions system
testDailyTransactions();

// Check if the sheet exists
googleIntegration.makeRequest('setupSpreadsheet', {}, 'GET');

// Get connection status
googleIntegration.getConnectionStatus();
```

## Future Enhancements

The daily transactions system is designed to support:

- **Advanced Reporting**: Monthly and yearly summaries
- **Performance Analytics**: Worker and service performance metrics
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in business operations
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate detailed reports for accounting
